# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

#Making_Jazz

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

#A website which asks the user to input a musical key and generates a 2-5-1 chord progression in that key.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

#The 2-5-1 progression is a staple in jazz music and can add a rich harmonic texture to a song. With this program, you can input a key and generate the 2-5-1 chord progression in that key, allowing you to experiment with this popular jazz progression in your own musical compositions.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will accomplish making a program which will generate chord progressions.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I will be able to turn the project into a website. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to create animations on my website, and make it the most visually pleasing to the user.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

This project will require me to develop skills in making a website using Python.
